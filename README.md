# FabDocMaker
------
##### FabDocMaker <Fab.Doc.Maker> is a very simple app made of forms to document the parameters of your last fablab projects locally, on your computer. You fill in the form, you add a few pictures, and you obtain a pdf you can send per e-mail, or upload somewhere on the web. You can also print it on paper to share it with someone. That’s it. Nothing fancy (at all). Just common sense at the service of fablab documentation. You can download the .jar and run it directly.

##### This is a beta version. It’s not perfect. But it’s stable. For now, it only works to document 3D printing and Laser-cutting projects. But if you think you can make a good form to document the parameters you use on your specific machine, go ahead: make a list of the parameters you would like your form to contain, send it to us, and we will add it to the app. Or just fork it from [Alexandre Péchereau's Github] (http://github.com/AlexandrePechereau/FabDocMaker)

##### We would specially appreciate to receive forms that would help documenting parameters for the machines listed on the Fab Inventory http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U-jcBWOJEjBT5A0N84IUubtcHKMEMtndQPLCkZCkVsU/pub?single=true&gid=0&output=html).

##### Also, think of this app when you need to document parameters during Fab Academy!
